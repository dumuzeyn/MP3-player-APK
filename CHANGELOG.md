# Changelog

## 2.1 - Repository quality update

- Moved the main music library, favorites, and playlists from JSON-in-SharedPreferences to a local SQLite database with legacy migration.
- Kept lightweight UI settings and playback resume snapshots in SharedPreferences.
- Added a `SongRowStateRegistry` helper so playback row state is no longer stored directly in `MainActivity`.
- Renamed the playback watcher from a generated-looking anonymous class to `PlaybackWatcher`.
- Added JVM tests for track sorting, legacy track JSON migration, playlist JSON round-trip, and playlist name cleanup.
- Release builds now run with R8 minify and resource shrinking enabled.
- GitHub Actions now builds the release APK artifact instead of publishing a debug APK artifact.
- Removed the generated APK from git tracking; release APKs should be downloaded from GitHub Actions or GitHub Releases.
